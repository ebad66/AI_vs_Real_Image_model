# AI vs Real Image Classifier

**Python | PyTorch | CNN | ResNet-50**  
**July 2025**

This project implements a binary image classifier to distinguish **AI-generated images** from **real photographs** using a dataset of 120,000 labeled samples from [CIFAKE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). The repository includes both training and inference scripts, as well as visual results.

## üîç Project Overview

- **Goal:** Build a model that can distinguish AI-generated images from real ones.  
- **Dataset:** CIFAKE dataset, 32√ó32 images, organized into `FAKE` and `REAL` classes.  
- **Models:**
  - **Custom 5-layer CNN**: Conv ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí MaxPool layers. Achieved **83% test accuracy**.  
  - **ResNet-50 (future work)**: Fine-tuning for higher performance. Achieved **94% accuracy** on validation.

- **Techniques:**
  - Data augmentation: random flips, rotations, normalization.
  - Early stopping to prevent overfitting.
  - Upscaling for plotting sample predictions.

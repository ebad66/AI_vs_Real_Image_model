# AI vs Real Image Classifier

**Python | PyTorch | CNN |**
**July 2025**

This project implements a binary image classifier to distinguish **AI-generated images** from **real photographs** using a dataset of 120,000 labeled samples from [CIFAKE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). The repository includes both training and inference scripts, as well as visual results.

## Model Details

- **Architecture:** 5-layer CNN (Conv â†’ ReLU â†’ MaxPool)
- **Input:** Images resized to 224Ã—224
- **Optimizer:** Adam, LR=0.001
- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy
- **Data Augmentation:** Random flips, rotations, normalization
- **Early Stopping:** Patience = 5 epochs

**Performance:**

- CNN Accuracy on Test Set: 96.2%
- F1 Score: ~0.965
- Final Training Loss: 0.0837
- Final Validation Loss: 0.1161

## Results

### 1. Training Curves

![Training Curves](results/training_curves.png)

Shows the **train/validation loss** and **accuracy** over epochs.

### 2. Sample Predictions

![Sample Predictions](results/sample_predictions.png)

Displays **balanced predictions** of FAKE and REAL images with predicted confidence scores.

### 3. Confusion Matrix
